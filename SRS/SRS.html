                  <p>
                    We are aiming to build a Classroom which is super minimal so it's easy to learn, use, and share with other teachers, students, and families. It is crammed full of features and is always updating with new integrations that allow you to access lots of free-to-use tools aimed to help make teaching and learning better.
                    While this isn't an LMS (Learning Management System), such as Blackboard, it complements many ideally and, in many cases, integrates as well. Yet as this Classroom becomes more powerful than ever, it is fast representing a new way to teach and manage the class online and remotely.

                  <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the biggest benefits of Our Classroom is it’s simple to use and encourages collaboration between students and teachers. Teachers can create a class and list educational apps, such as assignments, in a few clicks. They can add students by sending them a code to join. Students can then see what assignments are due, participate in discussion forums or message the teacher (either in private or via group chat). Classroom integrates with many student information systems, along with other third-party applications, such as instructional tools, digital literacy solutions and coding software. And this management system will also track student activities and send them to teachers so that students always remain engaged with their studies.

This system is provisioned to be built on the Django framework for web and Java for Android which is highly flexible.Decision regarding which database to use will be taken considering the fact that data being exchanged or stored is large, and the appropriate data management system will yield efficient performance.The other constraints are corporate, hardware limitations, specific technologies,communications protocols , security considerations.

                    <p>

                      The system will be interactive, and the delays involved will be less. So, in every action-response of the system, there are no immediate delays. In case of opening windows, forms of popping error messages and saving the settings or sessions there is delay much below 2 seconds, in case of opening databases, sorting questions and evaluation there are no delays, and the operation is performed in less than 2 seconds for opening, sorting, computing, posting the files. The performance of the system is dependent on how the load is delivered to the system. Due to increase workload, a peak workload will be defined.

System failure, login issues, account creation and password reset failure will cause  damage or loss  to the system. A backup system will
 be there for system failure which will be in archival storage.Information transmission should be securely transmitted to server without
any changes in information.

                    <p>
Security requirements includes authentication, authorization, data protection and so on . Authentication ensures that each entity
involved in using a the service—the requestor, the provider, and the broker —is what it actually claims to be.
Authorization determines whether the service provider has granted access to the Web service to the requestor.
Data protection ensures that the Web servicerequest and response have not been tampered with en route.
The main security concern is for users account hence proper login mechanism should be used to avoid hacking. The tablet id registration
 is way to spam check for increasing the security. Hence, security is provided from unwanted use of recognition software.
